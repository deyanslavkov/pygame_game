# Dodge and collect

### The goal of the game is to increase your score through collecting coins and avoiding obstacles:
* The player is spawned at a random location.
* The coins have a chance to disappear and appear, and when collected, they may disappear or teleport somewhere random.
* The obstacles move chaotically around the room.
* The player can move through using the arrow keys and cannot leave the boundaries of the room.
  * The player has 3 hp, and upon being hit, they will lose 1 hp and enter a short invincibility period.
  * If the player reaches 0 hp, the game will show a game over screen and close.

### What won't be covered:
* Multiple levels
* Remembering highscores
* Player attacking
* Player regeneration
